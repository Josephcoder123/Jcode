#  Welcome to the my Calculator! 
# We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 

#  input the first number
# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimals too. Fancy, right? 
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

#  input the second number
# Same trick here—using 'float()' for decimal magic! 
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Time to do some math! 

# Add the two numbers 
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Subtract the second number from the first 
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Multiply the two numbers 
product_result = num1 * num2

# Divide the first number by the second 
quotient_result = num1 / num2

#  Time for the big reveal! 
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  # ➕
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  # ➖
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  # ✖️
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  # ➗

# 🏁 And that's it! You've just made a mini-calculator! 😎💻
